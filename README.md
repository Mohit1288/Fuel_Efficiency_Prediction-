# Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This project analyzes driving behaviors like acceleration, braking, and speed to predict fuel efficiency, aiming to reduce costs and environmental impact. A machine learning model was developed and deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Problem Statement
Identify driving behaviors that most impact fuel efficiency to provide actionable insights for cost and environmental benefits.

## Objective
Improve fuel efficiency by analyzing driving behaviors and offering optimization recommendations.

## Data Collection
Data includes Total Distance, Fuel Consumption, Vehicle Speed, and other indicators collected from multiple vehicles.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Sorted data, calculated distance & fuel, created a fuel efficiency column, removed null/infinite values.
2. **Outlier Removal**: Used IQR and boxplots to eliminate outliers.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed relationships between fuel efficiency and driving behaviors.
4. **Model Creation**: Trained a Gradient Boost model achieving 82% accuracy.

## Key Findings
- Higher speeds improve fuel efficiency up to a point.
- Moderate acceleration and braking enhance efficiency.
- The optimal "Sweet Spot" exists within specific speed ranges.

## Tech Stack
- **ML Model**: Gradient Boost (82% accuracy)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Web App**: Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuel-efficiency-prediction.git
   cd fuel-efficiency-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
Launch the Streamlit app to input vehicle data like speed and acceleration. Click "Predict" for a fuel efficiency estimate.

## Conclusion
Optimizing driving behaviors like steady speeds and reducing idling improves fuel efficiency.

## Future Work
Expand the dataset, deploy on the cloud, add advanced visualizations, and incorporate environmental and traffic data.
